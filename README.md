This program was made to satisfy the requirments laid out by Draw it or Lose it. 

I did well revising the code to make it fit the customers needs. The code uses one instance of gameservice, and I felt I did really good figuring out how to create and call on
that instance, with minimal help from stackoverflow.

The design document was helpful, it was easy to organize a large group of thoughts. Getting lost and meerely glancing at a diagram made the development of code signifigantly easier.

I would revise the gameservice file. It looks messy and there has to be a cleaner way of writing it.

The users needs needs were derived of the companies vison. More or less, the company is creating a user need by making software requirements, and from those, constraints are identified. Considering the user is important, but making the company you are contracted to work for happy is much more important. 

Well, considering this project was mostly designed for us, I would say reading the diagram and following management is an important skill to know.
